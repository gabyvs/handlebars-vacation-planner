Vacation Planner with Handlebars
================================

This project is using handlebars to create a vacation planner application.

It shows 
* Vacation date
* Months, days and hours until the vacation date
* Options for places to go
* Votes gotten so far for each place

It also lets you vote for your favorite places.
